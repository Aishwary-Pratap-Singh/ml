I worked for the next 5 years at the Arrowhead Family Medicine office.','Unfortunately, my husband passed away unexpectedly in June of 2015.  This same Friday, my supervisor of 5 years relinquished the Arrowhead site to a former Supervisor who chose to write me up for all my tardies and/or absences that my former Supervisor worked with me on.  I took 5 1/2 months off on personal leave to attend to my 2 children who at the time were 13, and 17.  Additionally, I had my disabled parent living with me and for whom I needed to take care of as well.   After returning to work in January of 2016, and attending the funeral of my mother-in-law.  I was immediately reminded that I was on my first written warning and that any further tardies or absences would not be tolerated.  In August, 2016, my daughter returned to school to start her first year in high school.  She missed her ride and I had to take her to school and sign her in. Upon arrival, my supervisor, Linda Hallett, glared at me and I knew it would probably be my last day.  I workded the entire day that Friday.  At 4:45pm, she called me into her office to terminate me, she put her hands on me and tried to make me sit down to offer me some "resources".  She fired me 10 years to my service month, knowing that not only did I lose my husband, but I lost my mother-in-law in December 2015, My cousin in March of 2016 and My father in law in July 2016.  My daughter was suicidal for the first 6 months after her father died and my 17 year old son did not speak about his father for almost 2 years.  She never gave me credit for the great accomplishments I did achieve in my 10 years with Mayo Clinic and, ironically, she retired 6 weeks after terminating my employment and to top it off...she made me ineligible for re-hire.','The Needs of the patient are the only needs to considered...unless you are an employee".','Perhaps administration should  be as committed to their employees as they are to their patients and their mission statement...."The needs of the patient are the only needs to be considered".    I was an employee but I was also a "patient at Mayo Clinic".  It has taken me 3 and half years to get back on my feet and prior to working as an appointment specialist for 10 years, I was also a Licensed Practical Nurse.  I was financially, spiritually, and immorally treated by this person but no one seemed to be able to intervene on my behalf.  I suffered greatly and my career was ruined, all because of a new supervisor who, for whatever reason, had  compassion for my situation.  I spoke to everyone and every department begging for some kind of assistance.  I attended employee counseling for grief management.  This supervisor''s name was Linda Hallett.  She resigned 6 weeks after my termination but made my working environment  anything but pleasant, but exceptionally stressful on top of the stressors in my personal life.  She was relentless.  I hope that Mayo Clinic will read this documentation and remember that we are all employees with a single common goal...to help our patients, even if they are also employees.  One day...I hope to return to  Mayo Clinic, however, I am sure it will be very difficult as I have been labeled "ineligible for re-hire" by a very nasty, heartless former supervisor who was able to retire weeks after this event.  I pray I have the strength and the spirit to intervene on behalf of any person I may encounter to whom is up against an impossible to survive situation from a person in a position to "take or giveth" the benefits of working for 10 years with plans to retire with all the benefits that they worked so hard to attain. God Bless the doctors, nurses and all the medical staff who support them.  They are amazing.  Unfortunately, Administration lacks the convictions of those of us who are health care professionals, patients, and just ordinary people as well.','I loved working with patients on the phone especially since I had 5 years of previous scheduling experience working at the Hospital and ED discharge desk.

Raises have been held, yet the salaried employees didn''t have to take a cut. Positions aren''t being filled when someone leaves, instead putting more stress on the departments. Hours were cut back, there''s continuously understaffed units, done on purpose. They say their priority is patient care, yet they compromise safety by not properly staffing units just to save a few dollars. It''s ridiculous how downhill this company has gone in just 2017 alone.

I''ve always felt supported and encouraged to take advantage of HCA''s resources (Harvard ManageMentor training, tuition reimbursement, etc.) and there is opportunity to move around to different service lines. 
Health insurance costs are very low for non-smokers and ability to customize or opt out for dental and vision. 
My department and manager is very flexible and trusts me to manage my workload and deadlines within reason so I can run a quick errand or go to an appt during the week as long as I''m getting my work done.

First few years here, I was in love but the rose colored glasses have been lifted and I''m hoping leadership will take the time to right the ship for the people that keep it moving.','High points: 
- There is no actual maternity leave policy - Don''t let anyone fool you, it doesn''t exist in the policy bank. There is 2 weeks "parental leave" and short-term disability that is good until your Dr clears you (around 6 wks postpartum) plus you have to use a 40 hr elimination period before you can utilize this. If you don''t have the PTO banked, it is taken unpaid. So you can piecemeal about 8 weeks together and hope you can accrue enough PTO. The third party disability company is terrible.
- Salary is NOT COMPETITIVE and has not stayed current with a changing work environment and inflation. Cost of living has gone up so much in Nashville that market base rate for my job is about $40k higher than what I''m paid. 
-Internal employees are paid far less than new hires in the same role due to annual merit pay policies (or lack thereof) and wages are capped around a 13% increase from base for promotions, even if the job was graded out much higher than that (meaning, an external candidate applying for the same role would have a much higher salary offer than an internal candidate being promoted).

The pandemic brought to light a very outdated and non-progressive side of senior leadership and the board. Most departments are back in the office 5 days a week, it feels like priority is given to our stock price, not our clinical staff or resource needs - people or otherwise (when I started, we were trading around $72/share. Things have changed since the jump to $200+). I completely understand the budget and business management aspect of missing earnings, but it is a little tone deaf to earn as much money as the company did in Q1 then engage in cost cutting measures when our hospitals/clinicians are still reeling from COVID and need our support more than ever. We''re facing physician and nursing shortages everywhere, yet still cutting resources then trying to recruit. It makes zero sense.
Since the quarterly earnings weren''t what leadership expected and the stock price dropped, some divisions have started laying off staff as part of a "back to budget" initiative even though the company was still profitable.','Great but room for improvement','We shouldn''t be letting valuable talent go when the labor market is already a problem and will cost the company far more money in the long run.

The sun does not shine from your behinds, learn some humility with clients and employees, learn about both groups, question them personally about what is right and wrong with the Clinic with no fear of retribution.

Also, Mayo is becoming a very productivity driven company, packing in appointments and enforcing high quotas in departments company-wide. I feel this decreases quality based on the principle that, if you''re working faster, you''ll be prone to making more errors and potentially have less quality time per patient case. I think there should be some flexibility to allow for fine quality, where there needs to be. Or more providers and workers to distribute the work load.','Mayo Clinic Rochester has consistently ranked the #1 and #2 hospital in the nation.

Then because everything was so behind, we weren''t given the option to pick the holidays we would work. Upper management just threw everyone on the schedule without even telling us. We all had to find out by checking it, and then all we got was the most insincere "we are sorry but the company comes first" email._x000D_

My advice for management is to actually learn how to manage and not view their employees as just mindless drones designed to pump out as many calls and cases a day. My suggestion is actually review our annual surveys. Every time we did a survey and "discussed" it, it seemed like just another meeting of a "we will do better" and then nothing would change. Those annual survey meetings were just a waste of time and I only enjoyed them to take a breather from the phones.','Benefits are good. _x000D_

Even though Mayo employees about 26000 people, it has a "small town" atmosphere of helpfulness.. The only con I can think of is it''s large size. Sometimes when patients or newly-hired employees arrive, they can feel a bit overwhelmed by the size of our medical campus. Hospitalized patients are not used to having such a large team of staff assigned to their care. If it''s your first visit or you were just hired,  tell us, and we''ll be even more helpful. New employees are usually assigned a buddy who will mentor them through learning how such a big organization operates.',4.95425,'best reason work mayo clinic competency dedication staff highest level administrator lowest paid employee focused thing best thing patient obtaining date training job pride best medical facility country reason want work friendliness staff mayo employee people small town atmosphere helpfulness con think large size patient newly hired employee arrive feel bit overwhelmed size medical campus hospitalized patient large team staff assigned care visit hired tell helpful new employee usually assigned buddy mentor learning big organization operates',NULL),

I have been in meetings where supervisors have told several of my coworkers who had general concerns that they should be grateful that they even have a job because of everything that''s going on. In addition, the major issue that''s happening is if you happen to be on the call or an assignment that runs over or into you''re 15 minutes or your lunch, they are implementing rules that if you don''t get off on time or you don''t log out on time then you completely miss your break and or you only get to use what''s left of it (Meaning if you are on a call that runs 5 minutes into your break you only get 10 minutes left of a break or they''ll tell you you''re not allowed to take your break at all. The same thing for your lunch. If you are on a call and the call runs 10 to 20 minutes into your lunch you are only allowed to take a 50 or 40-minute lunch instead of a full-hour lunch). Everything you do is timed. Everything. More responsibilities are being added without additional allowed time. So if you get a patient or a client who is just so confused and has a lot of questions you only have 4.5 minutes to answer their questions and if it goes over that you are in trouble. You''re rushing them off the phone and leaving more questions than answers and you have 3 minutes to note the call in said person''s account anything over and your score suffers drastically and threats of termination role in. There is a lot of writing off the wealthy''s debt and sending people who are struggling financially and health-wise to collections. It is a very stressful environment. A large number of my team members have announced that they are seeking employment elsewhere.

You can sign up for leadership training with the approval of your supervisor( this does not guarantee any results of having a possible role in leadership).. So I''ve been there for quite a few years and it seems to be getting rapidly worse. I''ve seen a lot of abuse of power and covering up as well as retaliation. There are constant threats to terminate people for what is turning out to be any reason. Poor communication. Constant policy changes almost weekly to daily and you''re penalized if you do not know these. New hires with little to no experience are being offered higher pay than the current employees that have been there for years. People who apply for one of the Mayo clinics other sites and are hired for the said site but physically sit in another state are NOT being paid the posted compensation on the positions they applied for because they live in another state. Benefits are not the best at all (pricing and coverage details vary depending on which department you work for). You are treated as if you are a child (For example : The "Stars" kids get elementary, an almost exact replica and each "star" means something different) but instead of stars, you get coupons. For Medical Leave, you are only allowed to make up 3 days per quarter (even if your department is still actively working and during business hours they will not allow you to make up the hours ( as if the individual can control whatever medical issues or treatments are required for them; this also varies as to which department you work for.

Sometimes will miss payments for days and you''ll always have to recalculate every paystub to make sure it aligns with your hours worked.','Takes advantage of you in every way.','Profit maximization by raising patient census caps while staff are still in severe shortage is not sustainable. There is too little staff to manage patients in the double digits, especially in crisis situations - or when there are MULTIPLE situations on the floor. It is simply not feasible. 
Staff is overworked, tired, and underpaid.
Eventually, this setup will lead to a lawsuit on behalf of a patient''s maltreatment, of which management is complacent in (and dare I say, the root cause of).','Caring for patients is rewarding at times.
Decent system for announcing behavioral codes.
Works with your schedule at times.. Incompetent, detached management that only cares about profit, doles out new inane rules for staff (who are already overwhelmed) to enforce with threats of disciplinary action. Increases census cap without hiring or adequately training new staff. 

The staff environment is cliquey and will throw you under the bus if you are not someone they favor. 

Severely underpaid (almost always under industry average) with little chance of mobility/growth within the job.

Favoritism among staff and supervisor/unit supervisors.

Profit maximization is pervasive and there is little to no employee appreciation - even basic things such as not turning on the A/C or heat to appropriate levels during summer or winter months.

It  had attracted some outstanding scientists, and had an well-deserved reputation for excellent research, especially in genetics and brain diseases, good for building a pedigree for a young scientist. They have some very good resources for pathology and genetics, and for a small institute, the scientific facilities were excellent.  Pay was reasonable, but middle of the road. The health care package was excellent, medical care at the Mayo Clinic top notch. Most staffers are nice, happy people, good to work wtih;  handling of administrative matters is typically very efficient. Mayo Clinic is only about 15 minutes from the beach, so this made it nice to get away after a hard day at work.','There are  a number of serious issues with make me hesitant to encourage a young scientist,  interested in academic research, to consider working in the basic research institutes at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville, especially if they have a family and want a long-term appointment there. The Birdsall institute started to lose  its scientific luster around 2005, with the loss of most of  top notch research scientists between 2005-2010; this has left behind a shell of junior investigators and less active senior investigators. The star investigators have left for a variety of reasons, but all within the last 5 years. To top all of this off, Mayo has not been able to replace the lost staff with people of equal quality, in part because of financial cutbacks and reduced hiring incentives, but also because this insititute is quite remote; no one wants to live there. The nearest research institute of similar quality is over 90 minutes away in Gainesville.  _x000d_
_x000d_
Although branded as academic research environment,  if you are a newly minted Ph.D. looking for a comfortable university environment where you can dress down, let it all hang out, and personalize your work space, forget about it here. Mayo makes no bones about being a corporation;  they make it absolutely clear that you are part of their (corporate) Family, and expect you to adhere to all of their guidelines, ranging from dress code (one widely made fun of bulletin urged all employees to wear "color coordinated underwear") to what you can put on your desk ("No plants, family pictures, or personal items of any kind, please. We are a corporation, people, let''s keep it professional.")  _x000d_
_x000d_
As an employee, you will be  underpaid and overworked; and you get no retirement benefits whatsoever as a low level employee. If you manage to hang on for 5 years in a staff position, you become vested. (However, time spent as a postdoc is not counted toward a staff position, however; it is only after you get an academic appointment that the clock starts ticking, so you might end up with retirement benefits 7-9 years after you start working there, if you are even  favored with a promotion to an instructor.)  As a research institute within Mayo, there are a lot of soft-money positions, and PIs push most of their staff very hard; I have heard the environment likened to a "high-pressure boiler." A typical work week is 55-60 hours for a postdoc, accompanied by high pressure  to get in there and  produce from the PI. Firing can be at will, so make sure that you don''t screw up on the job or over annoy your supervisors. _x000d_
_x000d_
Looking at all of the issues,  the biggest failing of the Mayo remains the laughable promotion and management structure that is peculiar to the Institute. Management seems to be a fiefdom model (PIs are the kings, postdocs knights, and everyone else are lowly serfs), and you were expected to behave according to your station. As a new hire, If you are looking for a equitable academic meritocracy where you will be rewarded for your hard work and great ideas, or at least acknowledged here, let me disabuse you from your  illusions about this right now. Of course, not everyone behaves disreputably, but there are enough bad apples in this bunch to spoil this environment for everyone else. Although Mayo promotes itself as a meritocracy, when I worked there this was clearly not the case, and it was sad to see so many promising young scientists ground down by the unforgiving environment. Job promotion and prospects at Birdsall are governed by the recommendations of a self-appointed cabal of principal investigators who had a vested interest in subsuming power (a power clique) , most of whom have been promoted from within, some on their own merits, many not. The better faculty stayed out of this little power block, but it was a distressing experience to see this grow like a cancer  within the Institute.  One thing that became clear was that  favoritism and nepotism, rather than merits of the candidates, were the driver for the  promotion of certain individuals.   Consequently, well-liked  minted people could rise quickly through the ranks, while others who were not blessed by their betters would  get stuck early in the process, with no hope of advancement. How far your could you go up the ladder was  only modestly correlated with your productivity. Your job prospects depended upon who was  cheer-leading you. _x000d_
_x000d_
And finally, one other point about Mayo''s promotion progress is there hidden requirement that you need to be an MD to be in upper management; the MDs who run the place don''t care much at all about research (it''s not a big driver of incoming dollars, their bottom line), and have been cutting the financial underpinnings of this for the last 10 years. If you are a lowly academic, with merely a Ph.D., and you are looking for a management position, you won''t go very far; nearly all of the long-term senior management have MDs, so the odds are stacked against you if you as a basic scientist.','Not great for an academic career','Mayo administration needs stop the rampant nepotism within the division and make up their mind if they want a research program or not. As it is, the Instutite  is a mean little environment that  is out of step with Mayo''s mission to treat its employees as a "Family."  With the loss of  scientifically prominent people and budget cutbacks at the Institute, I see little reason why a newly minted postdoc should strongly consider going to an isolated branch of Mayo Clinic Jacksonville for a research career. A year or two might be OK for short-term postdoc''ing  to get your feet wet, but it''s definitely not what it used to be as a career driver for the budding scientist. if you want to make a long-term career, there are better, and more comfortable, places to hone your skills.','I worked in the Birdsall Research institute, one of the research arms of Mayo Clinic Jacksonville, for 13 years, from 1996-2009.

But the only job class/category not being reevaluated is secretarial positions.  The last change made to this job category was back in 2004 (11 years ago in March) and only a title change was made from Administrative Secretary to Administrative Assistant.  The pay range was not adjusted to reflect this change as is the case with numerous other job title changes at Mayo Clinic.  _x000d_
_x000d_
Part of the new Mayo Clinic culture is to invest in Talent as part of their Strategic Plan.  So why does Mayo Clinic not invest in the talent they already have on staff or by hiring those with specific vocational degrees and job experience instead of investing in someone with no work experience and a non-related degrees (i.e., Biblical Theology, Psychology, etc.) to perform Administrative Assistant work?  That’s the million dollar question.  Mayo Clinic sees talent as having a Bachelor''s Degree and no experience and you don''t even need to know how to spell or use proper grammar.  _x000d_
_x000d_
There are employees at Mayo Clinic who are currently doing secretarial work who have had their job title and job description changed along with a salary range increase but are still performing secretarial work.  For example, two women could be sitting in the same office performing the same job duties but, because one has a bachelor’s degree, is paid more.  To get around the federal rules the minimum qualifications are changed and/or the job description. However, a job description change does not necessarily mean that is what is being done in that job.

A lot of other job classes requiring Associate Degrees and/or Diplomas offer different steps that employees can move through in their positions; e.g., Research Protocol Specialist I, II, II & Senior, etc. For those of us who choose this as a career and have 10, 15, 20-30 years of experience in this field, we are not considered “talented” enough to be given opportunities unless we have a Bachelor’s Degree._x000d_

Unfortunately, for those of us who have vocational degrees/diplomas, we are not allowed to advance in our field of choice because Mayo Clinic is oppressing those of us who love this work and choose to do this work as a career choice.  For those of us who speak up, we are basically banished from ever going further in this field.  After dedicating many years of your life to Mayo Clinic as an Administrative Assistant you will eventually be capped at the top of the pay range.  At this point you will only receive the pay range increase and nothing extra.  Mayo Clinic used to give our Merit Increases to those who were at this point, but this has been done away with for the secretarial field.  All other fields get their Merit Increases by being able to advance to different levels within their job fields and by job titles being changed to make accommodations for exclusive employees to continue receiving pay increases.  In 2015, the pay range across the board increased 2% so that means those at the top of the pay range only receive a 2% increase.  Now that’s investing in your talent and investing in staff who give 1/2 their lives to an organization.','Administrative Assistants @ Mayo Clinic','Redesign the structure of all secretarial jobs at Mayo Clinic.  Do not allow hiring someone with a Bachelor''s Degrees into secretarial positions unless they have an Associate Degree or Diploma plus 2-5 years of full-time very specific secretarial work experience.  Make years of experience in the secretarial field a requirement for being qualified for a secretarial job. Working in College at a Work Study office job does make a person qualified to be an administrate assistant; especially considering work study students probably work less than 12 hrs/wk and how much secretarial work do they really do?','Mayo Clinic has Administrative Assistants; there are no perks to being an Administrative Assistant other than for those who are trying to enter Mayo Clinic as an employee - this is the way to get your foot in the door.. Mayo Clinic has been reevaluating a lot of job classes stemming from the Sirota Survey responses.  But the only job class/category not being reevaluated is secretarial positions.  The last change made to this job category was back in 2004 (11 years ago in March) and only a title change was made from Administrative Secretary to Administrative Assistant.  The pay range was not adjusted to reflect this change as is the case with numerous other job title changes at Mayo Clinic.  _x000d_
_x000d_
Part of the new Mayo Clinic culture is to invest in Talent as part of their Strategic Plan.  So why does Mayo Clinic not invest in the talent they already have on staff or by hiring those with specific vocational degrees and job experience instead of investing in someone with no work experience and a non-related degrees (i.e., Biblical Theology, Psychology, etc.) to perform Administrative Assistant work?  That’s the million dollar question.  Mayo Clinic sees talent as having a Bachelor''s Degree and no experience and you don''t even need to know how to spell or use proper grammar.  _x000d_
_x000d_
There are employees at Mayo Clinic who are currently doing secretarial work who have had their job title and job description changed along with a salary range increase but are still performing secretarial work.  For example, two women could be sitting in the same office performing the same job duties but, because one has a bachelor’s degree, is paid more.  To get around the federal rules the minimum qualifications are changed and/or the job description. However, a job description change does not necessarily mean that is what is being done in that job.  When employees witness such action, it is demoralizing to those who are working in the same capacity but are paid significantly less.  _x000d_

Gianrico talks all about innovation. Don''t listen to any of that. The dozen or so levels of warm spit between you and that vision prevent you from even the tiniest of changes. The only people who really get the patina of innovation are the ones who have played the game for a really long time and come up with the most mundane improvements that have already been in place for years at just about any other place. Generally by the time that "innovation" makes its way through the dozen or so committees, it becomes a freakishly complicated watered down chimera of bureaucratic bs and administrative jujitsu that doesn''t work and just makes everyone''s lives all the worse.  Oh and if you don''t agree along the way, if you fail at the institutional jingoism, you''re really in big trouble buddy and better shut up and get out. _x000d_

In summary, my advice to management: fire yourselves and about 10 layers of your subordinates and get the remainders to start anew. Abolish all committees (yes every single one of them). There are some really good people there, but eventually they all need to get out of that stifling environment in order to preserve their honor and dignity._x000d_

I wish it weren''t so. We all want to love the Mayo Clinic right? We all want to believe it''s a special place where miracles occur. This is all an illusion created by a well-funded marketing department which, like the communist parties in successful states, knows which buttons to push, how to push them, and when and where to push them. I have no doubt that if this review ever gets noticed, it will be censored, and a 5 page pamphlet will be issued that makes it look like none of the above is true.','$ (they do pay you for your soul).

Mayo Clinic offers excellent compensation for your time and very competitive benefits.  Its one of the few places I have worked at that still offers a pension, affordable medical insurance, several weeks of vacation upon starting, and decent lateral movement should you want to do so.  _x000d_
_x000d_
Mayo once offered a foundation by which you could make life long plans and aspirations.','So what happened?_x000d_
_x000d_
Mayo Clinic for the last few decades has continuously degraded by mediocrity, preferential treatment, poor implementation, ghost riding, and lack of vision. Mayo has been riding on the ghosts of its accomplished past._x000d_
_x000d_
A career at Mayo Clinic is an enigmatic one.  On one side of the coin you will be enthralled to work with able minded people who are not only skillful in the craft of science but who legitimately have passion for patient centered research and care.  I have had the pleasure of seeing people with drive who have worked from the ground up from a simple technician to become an administrator or even Ph. D, as I am currently working on.  The other side of the coin includes select consultants, senior/middle management, and even mid/low level scientists seem to think that once you get your “Golden Ticket” to Mayo you simply put your heart and mind into neutral and coast to maintain the status quo.  There are many wallflowers that only care about the bottom line: their paycheck or personal status._x000d_
_x000d_
While Mayo Clinic fosters brilliant and effective minds, there are just as many if not more that are busy waiving their “Golden Tickets.”  My time has been plagued with a few pampered consultants who verbally and psychologically abuse you, entitled management who are woefully under-equipped in wisdom/aptitude, and salaried/hourly technologists who get away with harassment or being paid for flat out not contributing.  You may as well not report incidences like these, since at any rung of the aforementioned nothing will change.  Rocking the boat puts you at risk for retaliation, ridicule, being overlooked for a promotion, etc._x000d_
_x000d_
The current status of Mayo Clinic would be as one of my colleagues put it, “…we have too many chiefs and not enough Indians.”  When you answer to many people, some of who may be inept or incommunicado with their own contemporaries, avoidable mistakes are made, inefficiencies continue to build, decisions that may be completely dangerous to patient care are created, and the overall mission of Mayo Clinic, “…the needs of the patient come first,” continue to diminish.  At the end of the day the blame is usually assigned to the easiest target or those too meek to defend themselves._x000d_
_x000d_
Mayo’s initial answer to the economic environment in 2008 was lethargic.  Excessive spending on parties, other frivolity, and business as usual continued.  Fast forward to 2013 and Mayo is virtually in a panic over cost control due to being overextended at the cost of morale of its employees and patients.  Benefits large and small continue to shrink or have disappeared completely.  Forward thinking and preparing for fiscal pumps in the road, not banking on changes in philanthropic donations, having MML be fiercely competitive with other health systems, ceasing kingdom building projects, etc. were not a part of the equation until lately.  _x000d_
_x000d_
Mayo is finally starting to take the punch bowl from its own party.  The problem is that while Mayo has been partying for the last 20 years the competition has become a lot smarter and leaner, where Mayo has become slow due to its own convoluted bureaucracy and over indulgence.  The withdrawals are very hard everyone especially for those that actually work very hard, since those perks were the things keeping the talent here. _x000d_

In the years I have been here I have seen magnificent individuals of all levels of employment be crushed by the current of “Mother Mayo’s” will.  When your lifestyle depends on who writes your paycheck, you always see the zombie like following of Mayo either too scared, too indoctrinated, or too burnt out to care to resist the crumbling paradigm that is the psyche of Mayo Clinic.','What happened?','Its time to cut the fat.  Mayo is the only place of employ I have had that has so many management staff and such an overly complicated bureaucracy.  Hold people accountable.  It doesn''t matter if it is a consultant or custodian, if they perpetually abuse colleagues or "the system" pull the plug to make room for those that will be the envy of other health care systems.  Isn''t that what Mayo is supposed to be about?  We need passion and talent.  We need to do everything we can to keep employees motivated not complacent.  We need to do all of this while keeping our ability to do so simple along with putting the patient numbero uno.','Mayo Clinic in the historic sense beams excellence.  Incredible minds and technology have been developed here.  Not too long ago that intellect and zeal were almost palpable in what could more-or-less be called the crown jewel of the city of Rochester.  I was honored to continue these traditions through my work and dedication at a place in aesthetics, aptitude, and psyche was an example for the medical community. _x000d_

Mayo Clinic offers excellent compensation for your time and very competitive benefits.  Its one of the few places I have worked at that still offers a pension, affordable medical insurance, several weeks of vacation upon starting, and decent lateral movement should you want to do so.  _x000d_
_x000d_
Mayo once offered a foundation by which you could make life long plans and aspirations.. So what happened?_x000d_
_x000d_
Mayo Clinic for the last few decades has continuously degraded by mediocrity, preferential treatment, poor implementation, ghost riding, and lack of vision. Mayo has been riding on the ghosts of its accomplished past._x000d_
_x000d_
A career at Mayo Clinic is an enigmatic one.  On one side of the coin you will be enthralled to work with able minded people who are not only skillful in the craft of science but who legitimately have passion for patient centered research and care.  I have had the pleasure of seeing people with drive who have worked from the ground up from a simple technician to become an administrator or even Ph. D, as I am currently working on.  The other side of the coin includes select consultants, senior/middle management, and even mid/low level scientists seem to think that once you get your “Golden Ticket” to Mayo you simply put your heart and mind into neutral and coast to maintain the status quo.  There are many wallflowers that only care about the bottom line: their paycheck or personal status._x000d_
_x000d_
While Mayo Clinic fosters brilliant and effective minds, there are just as many if not more that are busy waiving their “Golden Tickets.”  My time has been plagued with a few pampered consultants who verbally and psychologically abuse you, entitled management who are woefully under-equipped in wisdom/aptitude, and salaried/hourly technologists who get away with harassment or being paid for flat out not contributing.  You may as well not report incidences like these, since at any rung of the aforementioned nothing will change.  Rocking the boat puts you at risk for retaliation, ridicule, being overlooked for a promotion, etc._x000d_
_x000d_
The current status of Mayo Clinic would be as one of my colleagues put it, “…we have too many chiefs and not enough Indians.”  When you answer to many people, some of who may be inept or incommunicado with their own contemporaries, avoidable mistakes are made, inefficiencies continue to build, decisions that may be completely dangerous to patient care are created, and the overall mission of Mayo Clinic, “…the needs of the patient come first,” continue to diminish.  At the end of the day the blame is usually assigned to the easiest target or those too meek to defend themselves._x000d_
_x000d_
Mayo’s initial answer to the economic environment in 2008 was lethargic.  Excessive spending on parties, other frivolity, and business as usual continued.  Fast forward to 2013 and Mayo is virtually in a panic over cost control due to being overextended at the cost of morale of its employees and patients.  Benefits large and small continue to shrink or have disappeared completely.  Forward thinking and preparing for fiscal pumps in the road, not banking on changes in philanthropic donations, having MML be fiercely competitive with other health systems, ceasing kingdom building projects, etc. were not a part of the equation until lately.  _x000d_
_x000d_
Mayo is finally starting to take the punch bowl from its own party.  The problem is that while Mayo has been partying for the last 20 years the competition has become a lot smarter and leaner, where Mayo has become slow due to its own convoluted bureaucracy and over indulgence.  The withdrawals are very hard everyone especially for those that actually work very hard, since those perks were the things keeping the talent here. _x000d_
